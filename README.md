  Console airplane game with similar mechanics to Battleships. The goal is to destroy all of the enemy's planes first. The game is played against the computer, that has *some intuition* mechanisms implemented.

  The game starts by having to select positions of the planes. For each plane, there is the ***orientation ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W')*** and the ***position of the head of the plane ('A-J' + '1-10')***. After choosing the place of the planes, the game loop begins. Each turn, the player needs to pick one grid to bomb. If the player hits the head of the plane, the whole plane gets destroyed.
